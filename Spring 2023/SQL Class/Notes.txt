SQL - Structured Query Language
query - we need something to apply or point to and that something is the database
database - A database is an organized collection of database
    Operational - an active, dynamic colection of data that is being used in real-time
    Analytical - A static collection of data that is used to analyze past trends or events
Structured types
    Hieracrchical - the familiar treelike structure that limits the possible relationships between the data items and how the data can be examined. (think folders on computer)
    Network - A model of many to many that offers much greater flezxibility in how the data items can be related and examined
        Relational - (Very strict rules for SQL) 2D array is extremely powerful
    Object Oriented - A model that is far less structed, using objects of dat and software rules for both their structure and manipulation
Field - Name of a coloumn firstName/LastName etc.
Record - Holds every field that definies it even with empty fields
Primary Key - unique Name for a record
Foreign Key - You can import a Primary Key into another tabel but it is not the primary key for that Table
Orphanded record - is a record that loses its primary key
View - Holds no data but prints the data
Stored Procedures - do not allow any alertation of the data 
    One-to-one - A single record only links to one record in the other table
    One-to-Many - A single record links to many records in another table
